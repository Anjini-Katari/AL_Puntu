DISCO:
 * Always double check the closet for skeletons 
 * Can't use index notation when trying to access a specific index
   in a Integer array 
 * We've said this before, but writing print statements makes 
   debugging so so much easier (aids in tracing/visualization)

QCC: 
 * Why aren't the true/false statements working? Even after conferring 
   with other Thinkers, no solution was found :(
 * Next time make a note of all the methods given to us by the import
 * Clarify the points in your plan if there's any confusion
    * This may help avoid the situation we got ourselves in 
 * Unfortunely did not have time/was able to create a binary search 
   method -> is that easier or harder to code than a linear search
   * is one more effective than the other in this case? 
   * can they be used interchangably?


12.10.21 Notes
 * assume array is remians sorted (throughout initialization)
 * Have to 'type' array list

12.13.21 Notes
 * Realized that the structure we were following for the code 
   did not follow the directives so all the code was rewritten 
 * ALTester should only have the true/false scenarios 
 * OrderedArrayList is where all of the methods pretaining to 
   the array lie
